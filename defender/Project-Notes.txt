Things I learned about how to run the project:
- Running the docker instance initiates a server listening on port 8080, you run the test module seperately to send samples to the server
- Test module must be run in WSL!!!!!!!
- python3 -m test -m defender/samples/malware/ -b defender/samples/benign/ # note: malware samples were not read
